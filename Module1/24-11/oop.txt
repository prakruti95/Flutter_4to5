OOP -> Object Oriented Programming

1.object -> any entity which has own and state and behaviour
ex:pen,paper,chair etc..

2.class -> collection of objects
ex:human body

3.abstraction -> Hiding internal details and showing functionalities
ex:login page

4.encapsulation -> Wrapping up of data or binding of data
ex:capsule

5.inheritance -> When one object acquire all the properties 
and behaviour of parent class

6.polymorphism -> Many ways to perform anything

2)overriding

-> if method does not have a return type then it's also ok in dart

constructor -> method having a same as a classname
-> constructor does not have a return type
-> if you will create an object constructor calls automatically
